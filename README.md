# Malware-Prediction-Using-Machine-Learning
Cyber-attacks and cybersecurity are major concerns for every organization. It can also be said that Malware & security management is a cornerstone of security in the enterprise. There are high chances of a system connected to the internet getting impacted by the Malware, i.e., malicious software. Malware is a blanket term for viruses, worms, trojans, and other harmful computer programs hackers use to wreak destruction and gain access to sensitive information. The ever-increasing prevalence of malware has led to the explorations of various detection mechanisms. The breach in security can lead to data access and which could be catastrophic for any business. We can only detect a fraction of actual malware infections. To handle these successfully, it is crucial to take a proactive approach before a system being impacted by malicious software. We can use the modern machine learning techniques & probabilistic approach for this. It could be helpful to protect millions of machines, which may be on the verge of getting damaged by malware. The successful prediction of a system being malware infected in the future can assist in the prevention of getting the system malware-infected and can be useful for an organization to run their business in a safe cyber-crime free environment. In our first approach to handling this problem through machine learning technology, we are using the XGBoost Algorithm in Machine Learning, which is an efficient & high-performance algorithm. XGBoost is also known as the regularized version of GBM since it provides an extra edge in terms of supporting Regularization, Parallel Processing, Handling missing values, cross-validation, and ineffective tree pruning
